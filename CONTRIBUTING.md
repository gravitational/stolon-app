# Contributing

Stolon App is an open source project.

It is the work of many contributors. We appreciate your help!

We follow a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Filing an Issue

Security issues should be reported directly to security@goteleport.com.

All other bugs and requests may be filed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/gravitational/stolon-app/issues).

## Contributing A Patch

If you're working on an existing issue, respond to the issue and express
interest in working on it. This helps other people know that the issue is
active, and hopefully prevents duplicated efforts.

If you want to work on a new idea of relatively small scope:

1. Submit an issue describing the proposed change and the implementation.
2. The repo owners will respond to your issue promptly.
3. Write your code, test your changes and _communicate_ with us as you're
moving forward.
4. Submit a pull request from your fork.
