# recommended_upgrade_tag_between returns a recommended tag in from_ref which
# should be a safe Gravity upgrade to to_ref.
#
# Algorithm for determining safe Gravity upgrades:
#
# 1) end user provides line of development being upgraded from and
#    specific build being upgraded to as a git ref (branch, tag, hash)
# 2) find the date of the most recent commit X in the history of from_ref
#    that chronologically predates the tip of to_ref
# 3) find the most recent non-pre-release tag in the history of X
#
# This avoids several known failure modes:
# * #1735 etcd more recent in from than to. Avoided by chronological ordering.
# * Pre-release builds with unpublished artifacts. Many X.X.0-alpha.X
#   are git tagged, but not released. Avoided by ignoring pre-releases.
# * a release is skipped entirely. For example 6.1.23. Avoided by inspecting
#   tag history instead of a naive patch - 1.
#
# However there is still one known failure mode: A regular release that is
# tagged but lacks published robotest artifacts. At the time of writing there were
# several of these: 5.5.11, 5.5.16, 5.5.25, 5.5.29, 5.5.39, 5.6.2, 5.6.3
#
# After discussion with r0mant and knisbet, these look erroneous, and we want
# to fail CI if similar situations occur in the future.  We don't need to worry
# about these ones in the past, 5.5.x and 5.6.x both have more current releases
# that would be picked over any of these. -- 2020-06 walt
